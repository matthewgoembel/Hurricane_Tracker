# Hurricane_Tracker

This program implements a hierarchical tree structure to organize information about hurricanes, categorizing them based on their category, state, and name. The main functionality includes reading data from a file to construct the hierarchy tree and processing various queries on the tree structure. The Tree class provides methods for adding children, retrieving children, and sorting nodes. The program reads a data file containing hierarchical information about hurricanes and a query file with different query types. Users can inquire about hurricane names by category, state, or combination.

Additionally, the system can identify hurricanes affecting multiple states or falling under multiple categories. The output is presented alphabetically and adheres to the specified query formats. This lightweight and efficient system offers a streamlined approach to organizing and querying hurricane data.

Program test input and output is provided.
